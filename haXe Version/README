This release of FlodXM is not final, it is still in an early development stage, I'm just releasing it right
now because I won't have much time to work on it in the next months and I don't want to let people wait
any longer :)

FlodXM tooks 3 months to reach this stage so if you want to use it in any commercial production I'll ask you
to mention the proper credits and to make a donation to: chreil@hotmail.com via PayPal, thank you.
